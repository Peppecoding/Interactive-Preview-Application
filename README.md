# Interactive Preview Project

This repository contains the source code for a web-based application that provides an interactive preview feature. This application allows users to switch between different URLs displayed within an iframe. This is particularly useful for showcasing projects like the Media Collage Generator, Rock Paper Scissors Johnson Edition, and other web pages directly within the same window.

## Features

- **Dynamic URL Loading**: Change the content displayed in the iframe dynamically with the click of a button.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Animated Interface**: Utilizes CSS animations to enhance the UI/UX.

## File Structure

Below is an overview of the main files in the repository:

- `index.html`: The main HTML document.
- `styles.css`: Contains all the style definitions used across the project.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file that contains the logic to update the iframe's `src` attribute.

## How It Works

### HTML

The `index.html` file sets up the structure of the project, including the iframe and button options that allow users to change the content being previewed.

### CSS

`styles.css` defines the styles for the project. It includes:
- Styling for the container and preview section.
- Responsive breakpoints for adapting to different device screens.
- Animation effects for interactive elements.

### JavaScript

`script.js` includes the function `changePreview(url)`, which updates the `src` attribute of the iframe, allowing the displayed content to change based on the button clicked by the user.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to view the project.
